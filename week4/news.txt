hello and welcome
i'm miles o'brien
so how do you do a medical exam on a full grown gorilla
well if you answered very carefully you're right
but the exams being done on gorillas at the national zoo in washington could help save the species from an unexpected threat
jim angle reports
it's a mystery to veterinarians but from time to time gorillas especially males just drop dead
it doesn't look like a stressful lifestyle but male gorillas tend to have heart problems which usually aren't known until it's too late
these animals are very stoic is the word we use
they hide any illness they mask it and don't tell us they're sick you know
and doctors don't now much about these animals hearts because silver back gorillas are not good patients
when one of these guys goes to the doctor it's a really big deal
the animal receives a dart a remote injection by a dart because he's not going to let you just stick him with a syringe
we have to shoot a dart in him and he runs around and he screams and it's all very traumatic to have to do this and we can't do this frequently with these animals
this is gus a thirteen year old male
once he is under and his vital signs have been checked a human cardiologist steps in to perform an echo cardiogram
the same test given to people
this line here in the middle is the aortic valve closed and here it's opening
the doctors find one small weakness in gus' heart similar to one found in another gorilla
doctors will study this and the exams of thirteen other apes a systematic attempt to find out what is causing these heart problems and what if anything can be done about it
gorillas are an endangered species
we can't afford to lose these individuals to heart disease
one would think that heart disease is something we have a chance to do something about and to prevent
luckily gorillas have a much better lifestyle than we humans do
no smoking they stay relatively thin and they eat plants not things like ice cream
with a tendency to heart problems it's a good thing gus is in the zoo instead of visiting it

speaking of gorillas and hearts there may be a gorilla affair of the heart beginning at the atlanta zoo
ivan the gorilla is ready for another try at dating
this week he and a female named shamba were moved into adjoining cages to get used to each other
ivan doesn't have good social skills because he spent twenty seven of his thirty two years alone in a cage in a shopping mall
he was sent to zoo atlanta in nineteen ninety four
ivan's first encounters with female gorillas didn't go so well
they chased him and screamed at him
but zoo officials say shamba is a calmer personality less likely to give ivan grief
if all goes well the wall between ivan and shamba will come down in a week or two
